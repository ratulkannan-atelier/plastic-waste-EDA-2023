# Global Plastic Waste EDA

## Project Overview
This project explores **global plastic consumption and mismanagement patterns (2023–2025)** using data from World Population Review.  
The goal is to uncover insights into **waste generation, per capita usage, and mismanaged waste hotspots**, highlighting both scale and systemic weaknesses in waste management infrastructure.

## Data Sources
The raw data is included in the `data/` folder:
- `plastic-pollution-by-country-2025.csv`
- `plastic-consumption-by-country-2025.csv`

Source: [World Population Review – Plastic Waste Statistics](https://worldpopulationreview.com/)

## Setup & Requirements
Install dependencies:  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


### Dependencies
- pandas  
- numpy  
- matplotlib  
- seaborn

## Workflow

### Data Cleaning & Preparation
- Merged multiple datasets by country.  
- Converted text columns to numeric.  
- Handled missing values and dropped duplicates.  
- Identified and corrected anomalies (e.g., Poland outlier).  
- Created derived metrics:  
  - **Total Waste Produced (Tons)**  
  - **Waste per Person (Kg)**  
  - **Population Estimate**  

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Distribution of plastic use and waste per country.  
- Top 10 countries by:  
  - Total waste  
  - Waste per person  
  - Mismanaged waste (absolute & %).  
- Outlier detection and anomaly checking.  

### Visualization
- Clear bar plots with tons/percentages annotated.  
- Comparative insights across regions.

## Key Insights
- **India (7.3M tons, 98.5%)** and **Brazil (4.8M tons, 98.0%)** mismanage nearly all of their plastic waste.  
- **China (6.5M tons, 17.4%)** has the second-highest volume but far lower mismanagement rate, reflecting stronger infrastructure.  
- **High per-capita waste** in small nations (e.g., **Macau 328kg/person**, **Bermuda 168kg/person**) shows scale isn’t the only risk factor.  
- **Countries with ~100% mismanagement rates** (e.g., **Mozambique, Haiti, Suriname**) highlight systemic failures despite smaller totals.  
- Overall, the **dual challenge** is:  
  - **Scale** (volume of plastic waste generated by countries).  
  - **System capacity** (weak/no waste management).

## Next Steps
- Add **geospatial analysis** (world map heatmaps).  
- Explore **time trends** if historical data becomes available.  
- Extend to **policy analysis** by correlating waste with recycling regulations.
